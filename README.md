This README file serves as navigation guide for the folder ‘DSPG 2023_RS Workshop’. The folder contains the materials and code that were covered during a two-day workshop on remote sensing and Google Earth Engine (GEE). 

The file contains two Interactive Python Notebooks (.ipynb). The notebook ‘DSPG 2023 Crash Course on GEE in Python Day 1.ipynb’ was covered during the first day of the workshop. This contains a basic introduction on remote sensing and some basic definitions. It also includes code on how to download data on Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and precipitation from MODIS and CHIRPS, respectively, through GEE. The notebook ‘DSPG 2023 Crash Course on GEE in Python Day 2.ipynb’ was covered during the second day of the workshop. This contains an introduction on active sensing and code on how to download zonal flood statistics from Sentinel 1 SAR. The code was developed by Ozzy Campos and the package can be accessed through his Github https://github.com/ghidora77/SAR_Flooding

The file also contains two R files corresponding to each notebook. The data extracted from GEE were imported into R to be cleaned and organized. The R files also contain some code for basic mapping. 

All shapefiles and data files are also included in the folder.
