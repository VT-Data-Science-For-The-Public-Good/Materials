# How to use the template?
- Clone the repository
- Run the app_templates.R
- Make changes as needed(eg update links)

Notes: You can comment out unnecessary tabs

The app_templates.R is the simplified version if you are new to R Shiny. This template is modified from 2022 VT DSPG LandUse project. **The app.R if the original R file.**

# File Structure
- **\*.R** is the script for your Shiny App
- **data** folder includes your all data, you may create subfolder inside
- **www** contains all the picture. **DO not change the name of this folder** as it may cause errors to load your pictures.
- You are free to write your function in a R file and call it in your app.  Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13548266/define-all-functions-in-one-r-file-call-them-from-another-r-file-how-if-pos
