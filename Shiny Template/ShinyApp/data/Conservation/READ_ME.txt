Goochland only contains one type of conservation/preservation which is Rural Preservation zone. 

In Powhatan file, under 'Type' field, there are 3 categories we are interested in. 1. AFD, 2. Priority Conservation Areas, 3. Protected Lands. We will display the color by this field so there will be 3 different zones in Powhatan. 

Nazmul will write about the differences and descrive the things in the map.
